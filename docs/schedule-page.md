#### Week 2: A/B testing and planned peeking

By the end of this section, students will be able to:

3. Write a computer script to perform A/B testing optimization with and without using principled peeking.
4. Discuss the tradeoff between stopping earlier and certainty of significance, and thereal world implications (e.g., what does the FDA require for early stopping of clinical trials versus Facebook ads optimization?).
5. List other questions related to A/B testing optimization that may be relevant in a real data application (e.g., what features cause a Facebook ad to perform best?)

#### Week 3: Introduction to generative modelling

By the end of this section, students will be able to:

1. Give an example of a question that could be answered by generative modelling.
2. Explain how a linear regression can be used to approximate the underlying mechanism that generated the data (quantitative response and input variables).
3. Interpret the estimated coefficients and p-values derived from theoretical results for a simple linear regression (i.e., one input variable).
4. Discuss the assumptions made to estimate the simple linear regression coefficients and approximate their sampling distribution.
5. Explain how to approximate the sampling distribution of the simple linear regression coefficient estimators using bootstrapping.
6. Contrast the sampling distribution approximated using theoretical results with bootstrapping alternatives for simple linear regression setting.
7. Compute confidence intervals for the regression coefficients using theoretical approximations and bootstrapping results.
8. Write a computer script to perform a simple linear regression analysis.

#### Week 4: Different kinds of input variables

By the end of this section, students will be able to:

1. Give an example of a real problem that that could be answered by a multiple linear regression.
2. Interpret the coefficients and p-values of different types of input variables, including categorical or ordinal.
3. Define interactions in the context of linear regression.
4. Write a computer script to perform linear regression when input variables are continuous or discrete, and when there are interactions between some of these variables.

*Note*: due to the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation holiday, the list original learning objectives has been shortened. Topics removed will be covered later in the course, depending on available time 

#### Week 5: Model diagnostics and confounding factors

By the end of this section, students will be able to:

1. Describe heteroscedasticity and the problem it presents to generative modelling. 
2. Write a computer script to assess whether there is heteroscedasticity in a given data set, and if so, use practical solutions to manage it. 
3. Describe collinearity, the problem it presents to generative modelling, and whether this problem needs to be addressed
4. Write a computer script to assess whether collinearity exists between input variables in a given data set, and if so, use practical solutions to manage it.
5. Discuss what model diagnostics the data scientist can use themselves and when the data scientist needs to consult a domain expert.
6. Give an example of a real problem that aims to test a causal relationship between variables.
7. Give an example of a real problem where the model can only establish an association between the response and the input variables.
8. Discuss how the desired goal of generative modelling is usually to make causal claims but it is often not easy do so (e.g., in observational studies).
9. Discuss the impact of confounders in causal inference.

#### Week 6: Case Study
Presentation of a real case study that suffered from a problem of confounding. Part of the class time will be used for independent studying where the students will work on their projects with other group members. There's no class on Thursday due to "Make-up Monday" day.

#### Week 7: Model metrics for generative modelling and model selection 

By the end of this section, students will be able to:

1. List model metrics that are suitable for evaluation of a statistical model developed to make inference about the data-generating mechanism (e.g., R squared, AIC, Likelihood ratio test/F-test), their strengths and limitations, as well as how they are calculated.
2. Write a computer script to calculate these model metrics. Interpret and communicate the results from that computer script.
3. Explain the algorithms for the following variable selection methods:
• F-test to compare nested models
• Forward selection
• Backward selection

#### Week 8: Mid-term and preparation for projects

Review and mid-term.

#### Week 9: Introduction to predictive modelling 

By the end of this section, students will be able to:

1. 	Give an example of a question that can be answered by predictive modelling.
2. 	Explain when a linear regression is an appropriate model to predict new outcomes based on new values of the input variables.
3. Explain how lasso can be used to estimate a predictive model and write a computer script to use lasso to predict new outcomes.
4. List model metrics that are suitable for evaluation of a statistical model developed for the purpose of predictive modelling (e.g., RMSE), as well as how they are calculated.
5. Discuss how different estimation methods can result in different predictions.
6. Explain the difference between confidence intervals for prediction and prediction confidence intervals and what elements need to be estimated to construct these intervals.

#### Week 10 : Predictive versus generative modelling - what’s the difference?

By the end of this section, students will be able to:

2. 	Discuss how the research question being asked impacts the statistical modelling procedures.
3. Discuss why the model obtained directly from lasso is not the most suitable model for generative modelling and how post-lasso is one way to address this problem.
4.Write a computer script to perform post-lasso and use it to estimate a generative model.
5. 	Discuss post inference problems (e.g., double dipping into the data set) and current practical solutions available to address these (e.g., data-splitting techniques).
6. 	Write a computer script to apply currently available practical solutions to post inference problems.
7. 	Discuss how the research question being asked impacts the communication of the results.

#### Week 11: Cross-validation and work on projects (Thursday only)

There's no class on Tuesday due to the midterm break. Cross validation will be reviewed on Thursday. Any remaining class time will be used for independent studying where the students will work on their projects with other group members. 

#### Week 12: Introduction to explanatory modelling when the response variable is categorical or a discrete count

By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	Describe the logistic regression estimation procedure (categorical data as the response variable and explanatory variables), and Poisson regression estimation procedure (discrete counts as the response variable and explanatory variables).

5. Write a computer script to compute these model metrics. Interpret and communicate the results from that computer script.

#### Week 14: Project

This week is designed as independent studying where the students will be working on the selected project.
